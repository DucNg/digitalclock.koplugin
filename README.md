When running, this plugin completely disables auto suspend but it's supposed to be power efficient. You should be able to use the clock for about a week without charging if you disable all connectivity.

An info message will be shown when you need to charge.

The plugin is locale aware, feel free to open an issue if it isn't working properly in your language.
